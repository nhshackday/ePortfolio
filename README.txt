This project exists in order to develop an HTML5 app for the NHS ePortfolio website (www.nhseportfolios.org) that is used by medical staff in hospitals in the UK and around the world.

The app is designed to provide online and offline access to the user's eportfolio by means of a REST API. It is important that the communication between client and server adheres to the REST constraints.
